> The missing type system for your HubSpot objects.

### What?
This package generates explicit type files for all of your object types within your current portal, looking something like:

```ts
export type Company = {
    properties: {
        name: string
        some_custom_prop: 'cool' | 'cooler'
        // ... all default and custom props
    }
}
```

For convienience it also exports the full property definitions:
```ts
export const CompanyProperties = [
    {
        name: 'name',
        label: 'Name',
        description: 'Its a name!',
        // ...
    },
    
    // ...
]
```

### Why?
When using `@hubspot/api-client` with TypeScript, the objects returned are practically black boxes:
```ts
class SimplePublicObject {
    properties: {
        [key: string]: string;
    };        
}
```

So, we have a hard time type checking when reading/writing to the API and we constantly have to reference the web portal. With this package we can develop faster and more confidently.

## Usage
Install the package:
```bash
npm install typespot
```

Next, generate your files
```bash
npx ts-node typespot <YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>
```

You will see something like:
```bash
âœ… Created src/types/Company.ts
âœ… Created src/types/Contact.ts
âœ… Created src/types/Deal.ts
âœ… Created src/types/Product.ts
ðŸŸ¡ 403 Forbidden when reading tickets. Did you forget to assign scopes?
ðŸŸ¡ 403 Forbidden when reading quotes. Did you forget to assign scopes?
```

Alternatively, you may generate these files programatically:
```ts
import { TypeSpot } from 'typespot';
import { Client } from "@hubspot/api-client";

const client = new Client({accessToken: 'secret'})
new TypeSpot({ client }).write()
```
